## Code contributions

### Contributor license agreement

When submitting a pull request for the first time, you will need to agree to the contributor license agreement (for [individuals](./CLA-individual.md)). To do this, in the pull request please create a file with a name like `/contributors/{github_username}.md`, and in the content of that file indicate your agreement. An example of what that file should contain can be seen in [tmgrask's agreement file](./contributors/tmgrask.md).
